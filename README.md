The project focuses on modeling superior colliculus responses during a time period that precedes stimulation from one of the two sensory modalities (vision or somatosensation). Data was collected in high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI (N=80; N=40 in each sensory modality; between-subjects design).

The scripts include univariate analysis of task modeling and warping of first level result on group-specific superior colliculus mask and roi signal extraction and multilevel modeling.

Main analyses were done in Python (Sklearn, Nipype, Nilearn), mixed effects statistical model was done in R (lmer), visualization was mostly done in R (ggplot) and Freeview.
